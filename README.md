# ðŸŒ» Sunflower AR
Sunflower AR is a markerless augmented reality application that allows users to place a virtual sunflower on real-world surfaces. The sunflower dynamically rotates to face the brightest light source, simulating natural heliotropism behavior. The app also features realistic shadows that adapt to real-world lighting conditions using AR light estimation.
